## Deployment

- The following steps were taken for the deployment process (taken from the I Think Therefore I Blog project):

    **Project creation and initial deployment**
    1. Ensure that the template used for the project is made with the Code Institute template linked [here](https://github.com/Code-Institute-Org/gitpod-full-template). 
    2. Using pip3, install **[Django gunicorn](https://www.djangoproject.com/)**
    3. Using pip3, install **dj_database_url psycopg2**
    4. Using pip3, install **dj3-cloudinary-storage**
    5. Run **pip3 freeze --local > requirements.txt** so installments /dependencies can work on Heroku.
    6. Create Django project using **django-admin startproject** on terminal
    7. Create Django app using **python3 manage.py startapp** on terminal
    8. In settings.py, add installed the app under **INSTALLED_APPS**
    9. Any changes in database (changing models, creating a new app), run migrations to the database using the command **python3 manage.py makemigrations** and then **python3 manage.py migrate**
    10. [Create an account for Heroku](https://id.heroku.com/login)
    11. On the Heroku dashboard, go to **Create new app**, give it a name and select region and submit.
    12. On Heroku, under **Resources**, search up **Postgres** in **Add-ons** and select **Heroku Postgres**.
    13. On Heroku, under the **Settings** tab, click on **Reveal Config vars**, copy the **DATABASE_URL**. 
    14. In Gitpod, create a file called **env.py** (should already be in git ignore file in template used). Import os, and set up the **DATABASE_URL** environment variable where the Heroku **DATABASE_URL** will be pasted. 
    15. In **env.py**, also create another environment variable for **SECRET_KEY** and create your secret key. Copy the **SECRET_KEY** value.
    16. In Heroku, in **Config vars**, create a new **Config var** for **SECRET_KEY** and paste your secret key and click add. 
    16. In Gitpod, go to **settings.py** and import os. Import **dj_database_url** and create if statement to check if **env.py** is a file, to import **env**.
    17. In **SECRET_KEY** section in **settings.py**, import os.environ **SECRET_KEY**.
    18. In **settings.py**, comment out the **DATABASES** and add in **DATABASES** to add **dj_database_url** from **env.py** file. 
    19. In Heroku, add another **Config var**, KEY: PORT/ Value: 8000
    20. Create a [Cloudinary account](https://cloudinary.com/). Copy the **API Environment variable**
    21. In Gitpod, in **env.py**, add in the **CLOUDINARY_URL** and paste the **API Environment variable**.
    22. In Heroku, create another **Config var** for **CLOUDINARY_URL** and paste in the value from **API Environment variable**
    23. In Heroku, add another key for **DISABLE_COLLECTSTATIC** and set it to **1** since there are no static files currently. 
    24. In **settings.py**, add in Cloudinary libraries under **INSTALLED_APPS**
    25. In **settings.py**, add in **STATICFILES_STORAGE** to install Cloudinary further. Also set up **STATICFILES_DIRS** to connect to static. Create **MEDIA_URL** for **/media/** and set **DEFAULT_FILE_STORAGE** for Cloudinary media storage. 
    26. At the top of **settings.py**, create **TEMPLATES_DIR** to join base directory and templates.
    27. In **settings.py**, set **DIRS** in **TEMPLATES** to match **DIRS** to **TEMPALTE_DIR**.
    28. In **settings.py**, add your Heroku app name followed by herokuapp.com in **ALLOWED_HOSTS**, as well as **localhost**.
    29. In Gitpod, create **media**, **static**, and **templates** folders. 
    30. In Gitpod, create a **Procfile**. Type in **web: gunicorn [projectname].wsgi**
    31. Commit and push these changes onto GitHub.
    32. In Heroku, under the **deploy** tab, choose **GitHub** as deployment method, login to GitHub, and search for your project repo. Click **manual deploy** (or **automatic deploy** if you want GitHub pushes to deploy to Heroku each time)
    33. When deployment is successful, click **open app** to see your deployment. 
    **Final deplyoment**
    34. In **settings.py**, ensure **DEBUG** is **False** !!!!!!
    35. In **settings.py**, create the setting **X_FRAME_OPTIONS** and set to **SAMEORIGIN**.
    36. Commit and push these changes onto GitHub.
    37. In Heroku, in **Reveal Config Vars**, remove **DISABLE_COLLECTSTATIC** variable. Under **Deploy**, scroll down to bottom and deploy branch. 

- The following steps were taken for the cloning process: 

  1. Log in to **[GitHub](https://github.com/)**.
  2. Click on the profile icon to locate **'Your repositories'**. 
  3. On the repository page, click on the repository you wish to clone.
  4. Under **'Code'**, see the different cloning options, HTTPS, SSH, and GitHub CLI. Click the prefered cloning option, and then copy the link provided. 
  5. Open **Terminal**.
  6. In Terminal, change the current working directory to the desired location of the cloned directory.
  7. Type git clone, and then paste the URL copied from GitHub earlier.
